# Person Re-Identification AI Project

## üìå Description
This project focuses on person re-identification in a single video feed. It uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect and match people across frames, identifying whether the same person appears multiple times in different areas of the video.

## üß∞ Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python 3  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow / PyTorch (based on model used)  
- **Model**: CNN-based re-identification model  
- **IDE**: VS Code / Jupyter Notebook  
- **Input**: Video file (`broadcast.mp4`)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vasanthikondreddy/reidentification_ai.git
